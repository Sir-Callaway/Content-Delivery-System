<p>The Kenya Conservatoire of Music Orchestra is the highlight of Conservatoire concerts and is on great demand at corporate and social functions.</p>
<p>The orchestra comprises mainly students of all ages and abilities together with staff members. It performs in at least four Conservatoire concerts each year and also makes a tour every year to one or more towns in Kenya or even outside the country. We have played in Diani, Mombasa, Kampala and Dar-e-salaam. The Conservatoire also boasts of forming the first all Kenyan string quartet. We also have a junior orchestra and a jazz ensemble.</p>
<p>The Orchestra is available for <a href="/hire_us">hire</a> to perform at various events such as weddings, corporate functions and other ceremonies. Please call The Kenya Conservatoire of Music to make a formal booking for either the whole or part of the orchestra.</p>
